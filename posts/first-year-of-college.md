30 credit hours and countless late nights later, I finished my first year at Georgia Tech. To
say that it was a roller coaster of a year would be an understatement.

## Orientation Week

Week one was a blur. Georgia Tech had a week packed with events. Looking back, I can't explain
why I chose to attend certain events over others, but I'm glad I did. And not because I learned anything 
critical about Tech at those events (frankly, I didn't), but because I met so many new people. Keep in mind that 
coming from out of state, I knew literally *no one*.   

This was the one week that I was able to say yes to basically everything. I had all the time in the world.
*Pickup at the recreation center?* Yep. *Stay up until two in the morning at the library with some people I had just met?*
Of course.

It was great while it lasted.

## Everything Else

I realized a few certainties:

1. **It's incredibly important to compartmentalize.** During my spring semester, I interned part-time
   at a local startup. Let's be clear: many students do this. But admittedly, I could've done it better. Sometimes,
   I found myself doing work for my internship in class. This snowballed into *a lot* of outstanding work.
   When I let the line between school and work blur, I became less efficient.
   
2. **Don't trade your well-being for school.** I had my physics final at 6pm on a Friday. I was dreading it since
   I didn't feel confident a few concepts we had just learned. I studied until 2am the day before, woke up early the
   next day and immediately started studying again. I didn't have all three meals. I certainly wasn't having enough water.
   I developed a *raging* headache right before my final that lasted almost a week after. I was forced to take advil just to
   get through the day. I missed out on so many post-finals festivities. *In retrospect, it wasn't worth it.* I probably would
   have done better on the final had I just taken a break.
