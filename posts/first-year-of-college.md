30 credit hours and countless late nights later, I finished my first year at Georgia Tech. To
say that it was a roller coaster of a year would be an understatement.

## Orientation Week

Week one was a blur. Georgia Tech had a week packed with events. Looking back, I can't explain
why I chose to attend certain events over others, but I'm glad I did. And not because I learned anything 
critical about Tech at those events (frankly, I didn't), but because I met so many new people. Keep in mind that 
coming from out of state, I knew literally *no one*.   

This was the one week that I was able to say yes to basically everything. I had all the time in the world.
*Pickup at the recreation center?* Yep. *Stay up until two in the morning at the library with some people I had just met?*
Of course.

It was great while it lasted.

## Everything Else

The first class I attended at Georgia Tech was Linear Algebra.
